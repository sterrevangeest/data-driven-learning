    "In this assignment, I will use data from Mashable (www.mashable.com). Mashable is an online magazine that focuses on producing viral content. You may wonder: what makes an article go viral? Thatâ€™s what you will be trying to find out!\n",
    "\n",
    "The data comes from a study by Fernandes, Vinagre and Cortez (2015). The data set consists of over 30,000 articles with associated variables such as the title length, the article category and the weekday on which it was published. For simplicity, some variables have been deleted from the original data file, which can be found on Kaggle (a platform for machine learning).\n",

    "Linear Regression is the process of finding a line that best fits the data points available on the plot, so that we can use it to predict output values for inputs that are not present in the data set we have, with the belief that those outputs would fall on the line. assumes a relationship between the input variables (x) and the single output variable (y)."
